## Project Goal

The target audience for our final project is the typical U.S. citizen. We hope to bridge the gap between the citizen and the value of information held on this database by creating visual tools and quick access to relevant information. As stated on the National Institute on Money in State Politics’ website, they believe “knowledgeable voters are the strongest foundation of democracy. Our data is freely presented to the nation.”; however, we believe most voters will not view or even be able to comprehend their data in the form of tables/database. By bridging the gap between the database and the average citizen, we hope that we can translate the data into a more presentable medium appropriate for the average citizen and in doing so, create a more informed citizen.
In order to create transparency between citizens and their representatives, our project will intend to answer three main questions: “who?”, “where?”, and “so what?” The first question is Who is each politician getting their money from while they are in office? With increasing distrust in politicians’ commitments and motivations, identifying the primary donors to a given politician can help determine possible alternate motives behind a politician beside the needs of their constituents. The dataset categorizes each donation which we intend to utilize to determine which industries the politician is receiving donations from. The second question is From where are politicians receiving money from? Similar to the first question, we hope to answer the location of the source of donations but geographically. By doing so, we can visualize, via a map, where certain candidates are most popular (receive the most money from). The final question will attempt to answer if money is determining our politics, specifically, Is there a correlation between the amount of money a candidate spends campaigning and their chances winning the election? More money is flooding the political system than ever before, and our project intends to increase the transparency of election financing for the average citizen.

## Notice
When collecting data from the FollowTheMoney.org database, we were unable to collect the contributions to Democratic Presidential candidates.

If we are able to access these contributions from the site in the future, the application will be updated.
